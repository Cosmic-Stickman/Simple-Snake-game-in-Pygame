# Simple-Snake-game-in-Pygame
So, how to run this? So first download python from the microsoft store or from here : https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
Then type cmd in the search bar and open it (for windows). For mac, press command + space to open spotlight search and then type terminal (this will work for both) 
now type in the command prombt or terminal this : cd Downloads 
then type this : python start.py
the reason why you need to do start.py is because it starts the game, but if you do it from game1.py, it wont work. also dont delete the two files named apple.jpg and snake.jpg as they are the assets needed.
